# LFO_Framework
Initial Tool created by Santiago Ontanon - santi@cs.drexel.edu, www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi
Used in paper - 
Ontañón, S., Montaña, J. L., & Gonzalez, A. J. (2014). 
A Dynamic-Bayesian Network framework for modeling and evaluating learning from observation. 
Expert Systems with Applications, 41(11), 5212–5226. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.02.049

The implementation of Temporal backtracking is from M. W. Floyd and B. Esfandiari, 
“Learning State-Based Behaviour using Temporally Related Cases,” vol 829, pp. 9–11. Proceedings of the Sixteenth UK Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning, Cambrdige, United Kingdom, December 13, 2011

The BNT tool used is from https://github.com/bayesnet/bnt

New Classes added:

src/lfo/experiments

-SimModule.java - Runs the LFOFramework - See the how-to.md

-LFOFramework.java - new Framework built on top of old one to accomodate comparison of LFO in multiple domains. Includes a Tester and an Evaluator module that return performance measures on LFO on any (currently only) discrete domain. 

-ReadCsv.java - reads csv

-AutomaticPerformanceEvaluatorRoboCupLFO.java - old tool used to run robocup domain tests (Replaced by LFOFramework.java)

-Simulator.java - old tool used to run AutomaticPerformanceEvaluatorRoboCupLFO.java (replaced by SimModule.java)

src/lfo/agents/cbr

-TBCase.java - an agent that will create one case of a case based agent - for use in Temporal backtracking algorithm

-TBAgent.java - contains all the cases of the TBCase - it extends Agent.

Changes made to preexisting code:

src/lfo/agents

-Agents.java - added cycleNew() method which allows for input of a csv or space delimted trace file to be used instead of an xml file.

src/lfo/agents/matlab

Implemented cycleNew() is in all the classes that inherit this method:

-DiscreteDBNAgent.java

-DiscreteBNetAgent.java

-DiscreteNNetAgent.java

-DiscreteNNetOrderkAgent.java

-DiscreteBnetOrderKAgent.java
