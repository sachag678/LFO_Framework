In order to create a new Learner the following steps must be taken:

The learner must extend Agent.

Agent should have a constructor that at minimum takes in the trace files to perform learning. It can also take in the number of 
perceptions.  

Agent has a method called String cycleNew(String [] actions, List<Double> Perceptions, int timestep) which should be implemented.
The actions are the actions available to the learner, the perceptions are the current perceptions and the timestep is the current 
time. Some learners don't use all the parameters but to make it as general as possible, the method requires all 3. 
The method returns the predicted action as a String and it should contain the decision making.

Once this is done, a case has to be added to the switch statement in the Leaner.java file so that it can be selected as an option
in the simulatorModule.java
